<p>Trying something new here. I want something between Twitter and a month long complete absence.</p>
<hr />
<p>* <a href='http://mipsisrisc.com/rambling/'>Geoff</a> started his first day at <a href='http://www.bloglines.com/'>$work</a>.</p>

<p>* <a href='http://www.blowery.org/'>Ben</a> and <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/darktones'>Rob</a> are in town this week for <a href='http://www.bloglines.com/'>$work</a> stuff.</p>

<p>* Lots of talk about running EMCAScript from inside a <a href='http://hecker.org/mozilla/adobe-mozilla-and-tamarin'>flash 9 VM</a>, to generate HTML for things like the Feed Tree. * Really, we just need to figure out what the cost of copying data is</p>

<p>* Discussed why not having to write an <a href='http://www.wireshark.org/'>wireshark</a> plugin, and re-using HTTP as a transport protocol is good thing.</p>

<pre><code>* Okay, so for those who don&#39;t know, back at Cyan, Rob and I wrote an Ethereal (since-renamed to wireshark) plugin, which code decoded the Uru Online network packets.  But the unique thing is that it actually ran the real _network layer_ and de-serialization routines, used by the actual engine, inside ethereal, meaning you could easily introspect objects, as they were packed over the wire.  It is still one of the coolest things I have worked on, at least from being in an oh-shit-something-is-broken situation.  To be able to know exactly what is going on with complex network applications is priceless.</code></pre>

<p>* Rob merged <a href='http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/berkeley-db/db/changeLog.html'>Berkeley DB 4.5</a> to trunk. Woot.</p>

<p>* Researched various <strong>embedded</strong> HTTP Server Libraries:</p>

<pre><code>* [shttpd](http://shttpd.sourceforge.net/) - Looks like the best. Actively maintained, good license.</code></pre>

<p>Overall, I was quite disappointed by the overall quality and quantity of embeddable servers. If you are writing a client, there is <a href='http://curl.haxx.se/'>curl</a> or <a href='http://code.google.com/p/serf/'>serf</a>; But if you want a self contained server, and don&#8217;t want to make <a href='http://www.apachetutor.org/'>an apache module</a> for various reasons, there just aren&#8217;t many good options.</p>

<p>* Re-inventing SOAP and object serialzation system without the sucky parts with a staticly typed language like C++ sucks. I wish I had Python.</p>

<p>* Cookies from the <a href='http://www.pacificcookie.com/'>Pacific Cookie Company</a> are good. And they ship them, extremely quickly.</p>

<p>* I went to Fry&#8217;s twice today. Once I came back with a 320GB Firewire Drive, the second time with Firewire 400 cables. It turns out, it only came with a 9-pin Firewire 800 cable, which doesn&#8217;t work so well in an original MacBookPro. Guess this means I need a new computer.</p>

<p>* Dinner at the <a href='http://www.rockbottom.com/RockBottomWeb/RBR/Home.aspx'>Brewery</a>:</p>

<pre><code>* [DHH](http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000608.html) and [Mark](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/04/16/dhh-translation) are both crazy.  But, Mark is way funnier.
  * PS: I _wish_ my scaling problems were about storing only 255 bytes per post.



* More on running EMCAScript inside Flash VMs to do &#39;heavy&#39; client side work.</code></pre>

<p>* Started ripping Dead Like Me, Season 1 DVDs. <a href='http://handbrake.m0k.org/'>Handbarke</a> FTW. (DVD Ripping software for the Mac)</p>

<h2 id='metrics'>Metrics:</h2>

<p>* 1 work meeting *</p>

<p>* 3 work emails.</p>

<p>* 3 work svn commits</p>

<p>* 1 non-work email.</p>

<p>* 0 non-work svn commits</p>

<p><strong>edit, more:</strong></p>

<p>* I banned 200+ Casino Spammers from Bloglines this morning. I hate spammers.</p>

<p>* Is typo&#8217;ing &#8216;shirt&#8217; for &#8216;shit&#8217;, a feature or a bug?</p>
