<p><a href='http://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2007/07/14/iphone'>Last Saturday</a>, I got an iPhone. It was great, but the full size Bloglines on it, with the <a href='http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305899'>Zoom Mode</a>, sucked. Trying to read large volumes of text is a massive pain on the iPhone.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, I started working on an iPhone specific site for Bloglines. By mid-afternoon on Sunday, I had something that worked reasonably well.</p>

<p>I spent the rest of this week taking in refinements and new feature suggestions from everyone inside the company.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone on the Bloglines team for helping out with this project. It is by far the coolest thing we have released this year so far.</p>

<p>The iBloglines site is written with:</p>

<p>* 253 lines of C++ in 5 files</p>

<p>* 382 lines of client side Javascript in 1 file</p>

<p>* 287 lines of ETL Templates in 8 files</p>

<p>Of course, this is only counting the code we wrote specifically for the iPhone, but it does make me doubt that you need to use a Scripting Langauge for rapid development, if your framework is good enough.</p>

<p>iBloglines is built upon <a href='http://joehewitt.com/iui/'>iUI</a> . Originally we tried to just using it as a base, but in the end, we essentially forked it. We entertained using <a href='http://dojotoolkit.org/'>Dojo 0.9</a> on the iPhone, but since the only required browser to support is MobileSafari, it would of been pretty heavy.</p>

<p>We used <a href='http://etl.i-want-a-pony.com/'>The Electric Template Language</a>, or ETL for generating the HTML. Relatively young compared to things like <a href='http://www.clearsilver.net/'>ClearSilver</a>, it is much cleaner and was a joy to work with.</p>

<p>Developing for the iPhone has been pretty fun, but I believe Apple has been less helpful that they should be.</p>

<p><strong>We might not need a SDK for &#8216;native&#8217; Applications, but we need better tools for the iPhone.</strong></p>

<p>Simple things, like making an official iPhone Simulator, like Microsoft has <a href='http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsmobile/bb264327.aspx'>for Windows Mobile</a>, which had identical rendering to the iPhone would be very helpful. <a href='http://www.marketcircle.com/iphoney/'>iPhoney</a> is a good start, but it really should be an official Apple Developer tool.</p>

<p>We did most of our development on Firefox with <a href='http://www.getfirebug.com/'>Firebug</a>, and then ported it to the MobileSafari later, because the tools for Firefox are so much better.</p>

<p>In closing: I love my iPhone, I hope Apple will hurry up and make better developer tools, and I hope the Bloglines users enjoy the new <a href='http://i.bloglines.com/'>iBloglines</a>!</p>
