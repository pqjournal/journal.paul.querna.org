    <p><a href='http://campfirenow.com'>Campfire</a> seems great. We have been playing with using it at <a href='http://www.bloglines.com/'>work</a>, rather than our internal IRC network, after <a href='http://37signals.blogs.com/products/2007/07/web-firm-viget-.html'>seeing this blog post</a>.</p>

<p>The UI is great, the file sharing is great&#8230; But the only major blocking issue right now is the complete lack of an API.</p>

<p>Most other 37 signals <a href='http://loggedoff.org/articles/2006/07/20/api-projects-for-37signals-applications/'>apps have official APIs</a>, but Campfire only has an unofficial &#8216;API&#8217; which is just a <a href='http://rubyforge.org/projects/tinder'>Ruby Module which scrapes the HTML</a>.</p>

<p>Look, Ruby is great, but when you are integrating a large project, with existing chat services, you need a standard protocol with good API libraries. Right now on our IRC channel, we have Bots written in Ruby, Python, TCL, and C/Lua.</p>

<p>They perform all kinds of services, from searching Google, to SVN commit notification, to controlling our <a href='http://buildbot.sourceforge.net/'>buildbot builds</a>.</p>

<p>If Campfire at least had some kind of official API, it could be XML based, JSON based, or even something else, I don&#8217;t really care &#8211; it would allow us to easily port our existing tools in many languages. Heck, if it had an API, you could also make a <a href='http://www.danga.com/djabberd/'>Jabber Gateway easily</a>.</p>

<p>So, here is my request to 37 signals: <strong>I just want an API.</strong></p>

<p>An API so we can become entrenched into your solution. So we would never leave. Right now its a hard sell &#8211; we would be either writing/porting Tinder for 3 or more languages, or investing lots of time in a Ruby based Proxy of some kind, but that all seems excessive. Look at the other 37 signals apps with APIs, a whole ecosystem of things that support your products appear. APIs are good for you, and good for us, a potential user.</p>
