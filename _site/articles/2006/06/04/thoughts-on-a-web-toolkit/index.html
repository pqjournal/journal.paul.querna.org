    <p>I have been doing lots of &#8216;Web Development&#8217; in C/C++ in the last year.</p>

<p>The current workflow currently isn&#8217;t that bad, mostly because we use <a href='http://www.clearsilver.net/'>ClearSilver</a> to do many of the hard parts.</p>

<p>Now, ClearSilver is an okay <a href='http://www.clearsilver.net/docs/man_templates.hdf'>template language</a>, nothing amazing, but its pretty damn fast, and it works. However, ClearSilver also includes a &#8221;<a href='http://www.clearsilver.net/docs/man_cgi.hdf'>CGIKit</a>&#8221; API, which tries to handle many of the hard parts of running a writing a CGI in C. I would rate the CGIKit as only mediocre, and I have had to dig through it a couple times to extend things or even figure out what the heck it is doing.</p>

<p>I have been thinking about writing a replacement for the CGIKit portion of the API, and using the <a href='http://etl.i-want-a-pony.com/'>Electric Template Language</a> from <a href='http://asdf.blogs.com/'>Garrett</a>.</p>

<p>For the API, I am trying to decide between a Monolithic approach, or a more modular one. A simple question: should the API create the concept of Handlers based on URI prefixes, or should you do that yourself?</p>

<p>For example, if the Toolkit was more Monolithic, you would have an API like this:</p>

<blockquote />

<p>pwt_register_handler(&#8220;/one&#8221;, one_handler_func);</p>

<p>pwt_register_handler(&#8220;/two&#8221; two_handler_func);</p>

<p>pwt_run_handler();</p>

<p>Which would then call the appropriate function handler if the prefix was matched.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a more modular approach would look like this:</p>

<blockquote />

<p>if (pwt_prefix_match(pwt, &#8220;/one&#8221;)) {</p>

<blockquote />

<p>one_handler_func(pwt);</p>

<blockquote />

<p>}</p>

<p>else if (pwt_prefix_match(pwt, &#8220;/two&#8221;)) {</p>

<p>two_handler_func(pwt);</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>Now, the second example is more flexible, allowing you to put hacks in as needed, but it means more code is written.</p>

<p>Of course, now you say, if you design the API correctly, you can do both, and easily degrade into the more modular method when you need that control, which isn&#8217;t the common case. Right, I have no doubts about that, it just means iterating on the API more before much is finalized, to find those points that need to be able to &#8216;degrade&#8217;.</p>

<p>The other challenge in the API design is that I want it to support a CGI mode, FastCGI Mode, and possibly a native Apache Module Handler Mode. I am pretty sure with some macro-magic that can be done &#8211; and hopefully without hurting either method significantly.</p>

<p>Lastly, I am having an internal debate on if it should be pure-C, or use C++. I think several parts could be made easier with C++ &#8211; for example you could make you own Classes based off a base PWTHandler and subclass them as needed to your own situation. I believe many C++ &#8216;libraries&#8217; do correctly have a stigma to them &#8211; it is too easy to say, well, i need XYZ, and then just #include boot/foobar.hpp. And now you depend on <a href='http://www.boost.org/'>Boost</a>. C Libraries have a consistent history in open source of working well. While C++ is exactly the opposite for the most part. To people who read my blog, do you care which language it is in? Does either one matter to you?</p>

<p>I have little doubt that all of my goals can be accomplished in straight C, but I think it will end up abusing Macros in ways that I hate to get the lines of code per new handler down to the same number as in C++.</p>
