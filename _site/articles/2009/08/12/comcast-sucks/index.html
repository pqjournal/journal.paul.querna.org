    <p>I pay Comcast $155.00 a month for TV and fast internet &#8211; baring the download limits I never hit, It is an acceptable service, even if still overpriced.</p>

<p>Yesterday I got a call from Comcast.  I didn&#8217;t think much of it.  At least how I remember it, the lady said the Auto-bill pay had made a mistake and over charged me for July.  $240 instead of $155 or something.  And they noticed this mistake, and <em>had corrected it</em>. Great so.. I should just be getting a credit. Woohoo money back I never noticed leaving.</p>

<p>Today when I woke up, <em><strong>the internet wasn&#8217;t working</strong></em>.</p>

<p><img src='http://journal.paul.querna.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/monopoly-go-to-jail-card.jpg' alt='monopoly-go-to-jail-card' /></p>

<p>It was showing a stupid comcast activation screen.  To activate&#8230;. it wanted me to download some comcastic activation software.  Screw it, I was feeling particularly dumb this morning and I did on my older Macbook Pro.  <a href='http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r20809661-OS-X-Comcast-removed-my-airport-icon'>It completely FUBARed up my network settings</a>.  Glad I didn&#8217;t do it on my primary work machine.</p>

<p>Okay, well, one dead laptop later, I decided to call Comcast.</p>

<p>I will give Comcast some credit here, I was speaking to a Real Human Being in less than 2 minutes.  I remember being on hold for USWest/Qwest for hours when dealing with any DSL issues.</p>

<p>I just try to play dumb, &#8216;my internet has stopped working&#8217;, and the lady says it was turned off for non-payment.</p>

<p>Non-payment? I&#8217;ve had auto-bill pay on for 4 years, since I moved in.  I have auto-bill-pay with Comcast because I never ever ever want to deal with their crap or be on the phone with them. <strong>I WANT FAST INTERNET AND LEAVE ME ALONE.</strong></p>

<p>It turns out that $242 was from someone ELSE who had paid onto MY account in June.</p>

<p>What happened yesterday is that Comcast reversed that payment, and since the auto-bill pay thought I had already paid for June and most of July, and now I had a delinquent charge of $242, overdue for 2 months.</p>

<p>So they turned off my service.</p>

<p>Well, turning off my service for when they fucked up sure is one way to get my attention.</p>

<p>So, I paid $403 to keep the internet flowing.  It isn&#8217;t like I had a choice in high speed internet.</p>

<p>In my rage I did change my TV plan from Digitial Rare-Metal to the basic standard plan, but I wish I could of just canceled my entire account.</p>

<p><strong>If I had a choice, I would choose any other service that can offer me 20 megabit/second downloads</strong>.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T in theory can offer DSL service in my area, but I don&#8217;t have a landline, and they don&#8217;t offer anywhere near 20mbit/second downloads.</p>

<p><em><strong>Sigh.</strong></em> Edit: While writing this post, Safari crashed. Twice.  :rage:</p>
