    <p>I did a <a href='http://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2010/03/13/sxsw-day-1/'>post about the first day at SXSW</a>, but I failed to post any others for the following 9 days.  I also made 0 tweets, but successfully checked into a total of 4 places on foursquare.</p>

<p>I am absolutely terrible at this Blogging/Twitter/foursquare thing.</p>

<p>Anyways, SXSW was a blast.  Austin is a great city, and everyone that went there with Cloudkick had a great time.</p>

<p>The high and low lights:</p>

<p>* Most Memorable: <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194263/'>Get Low</a> - Bill Murray, Robert Duvall, and Sissy Spacek all came to this screening.  Did the Q&amp;A afterwords, and Bill Murray great.  Movie while it has some humor building up to the final scene thanks to Bill Murray, was really all about great acting by Robert Duvall.</p>

<p>* They let you Bar tend? - A <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamikaze_%28cocktail%29'>Kamikaze</a> does not include cranberry juice.  I know there are a ton of bars (and therefore you need a ton of bar tenders) in Austin, but really?</p>

<p>* Wow: <a href='http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/'>Werner Vogel</a> at the <a href='http://datacluster.infochimps.org/'>Big Data Cluster meetup</a>.  Great job by <a href='http://twitter.com/stuhood'>Stu Hood</a> to refute some of his silliness, and it was good to meet more Apache Cassandra developers, like the current PMC chair <a href='http://spyced.blogspot.com/'>Jonathan Ellis</a> in person.</p>

<p>* New Favorite Band: <a href='http://murderbydeath.com/'>Murder by Death</a>- I loved the combination of Electronic Cello, with the deep voice and great songs.</p>

<p>* Best non-BBQ Food: <a href='http://www.koriente.com/'>Koriente</a> - Nice and Fresh food, and of course bubble tea.  Not that we went to many non-BBQ places this week, but this restaurant was a pleasant surprise and break from BBQ.</p>

<p>* Best BBQ: Not sure, we went to many BBQs spots, including Stubbs, Iron Works, and Salt Lick.  Salt Lick I guess was a cool experience, but I did enjoy the night <a href='http://twitter.com/rphillips'>Ryan Phillips</a> brought over Rudy&#8217;s to our Roof Deck.</p>

<p>* Speakin of Roof Decks:  Wow, we got really lucky with the place we rented for the week, a roof deck overlooking the entire downtown.</p>

<p>* Best Pass: I think I enjoyed the Film pass by far, the Interactive&#8230; I honestly went to like 3 sessions.  Music was good too, but I felt like I don&#8217;t get to see many movies, while music is easier to experience over the internet without a 2 hour time sink.</p>
