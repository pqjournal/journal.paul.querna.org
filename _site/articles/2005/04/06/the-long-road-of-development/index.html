    <p>I released <a href='http://www.outoforder.cc/projects/apache/mod_gnutls/'>mod_gnutls</a> today. I started hacking on the idea in August 2004, more than 7 months ago. This is the longest any of my open source modules have been under development without a release.</p>

<p>mod_gnutls is an alternative to mod_ssl. mod_ssl is a giant beast of a module &#8211; no offense to it&#8217;s authors is intended &#8211; but I believe it has fallen prey to massive feature bloat.</p>

<p>When I started hacking on httpd, mod_ssl remained a great mystery to me, and when I actually looked at it, I ran away. The shear ammount code is depressing, and it does not conform to the style guidelines. It was painful to read, and even harder to debug. I wanted to understand how it worked, and I had recently heard about GnuTLS, so long story short, I decided to write mod_gnutls.</p>

<p>Lines of Code in mod_ssl: 15,324</p>

<p>Lines of Code in mod_gnutls: <strong>1,886</strong></p>

<p>One of the unique features is support for a distributed SSL Session Cache using <a href='http://www.danga.com/memcached/'>memcached</a>. If anyone has a cluster of HTTPS servers, and would like a performance boost, I would love some test results.</p>

<p>Right now its not quite a viable alternative to mod_ssl &#8211; it mostly needs testing and some serious code reviews. I plan to add full support for SSL Client Certificates in the next version.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure I will release a 0.1.1 in the next week that can compile on the 2.0.x branch. There are a few function renames that force the current 0.1.0 release to require the 2.1.x-dev branch.</p>

<p>It only took 7 months of hacking, but I am happy with the results so far. mod_gnutls forced me to truely learn about input and output filters like never before. The best way to really understand something is to write it from scratch &#8211; and the result is that I now understand mod_ssl and GnuTLS better than before.</p>
