    <p>The <a href='http://corelands.com/blog/?postid=82'>Debunking lighttpd</a> post has gotten a few harsh comments. Here are some of my replies.</p>

<p>Quote from Anonymous:</p>

<p>You neglect two things in your discussion: What happens when resources become constrained. For instance what if 10000 slow clients connect to both servers. Which is easier to configure for the task at hand. There are a lot of advantages to using single threaded or tread / core servers. In my opinion this model maps much more closely to the underlying hardware, and many of the problems of multi-threaded systems just don&#8217;t exist. The market is certainly big enough for multiple players</p>

<p>First point, I don&#8217;t have a setup to properly test 10,000 slow clients. If you want to model realistic client connections, then a completely different benchmarking methodology is needed. ApacheBench is very good at slinging requests in relatively high volume from a single client, but realistic is something that it does not try to be at all. Someone could write a PHD thesis on realistic modeling of HTTP Clients and Benchmarking. I don&#8217;t have the time, the hardware, or willingness to do that right now.</p>

<p>Second point, easier to configure is highly variable based on the administrator experiences. For me, httpd is easier to configure. YMMV.</p>

<p>Quote from Anonymous:</p>

<p>you make the claim that apache bench sucks, but provide no reasons as to why. You also provide little information about the test itself, results (other than a nice graph), or much information to duplicate the test. I would also be interested in system load at various times during the test too. I would like to say..wow..that is one of the simplest and cleanest apache conf files I have ever seen! :D</p>

<p>ApacheBench Sucks. Why? It can&#8217;t scale. It uses some blocking IO, but tries to use a single/threaded event paradigm. It has no concept of timing. Its understanding of HTTP/1.1 is limited to KeepAlives. <a href='http://weblog.erenkrantz.com/weblog/2005/06/05#anandtech-benchmarks'>Justin calls ApacheBench &#8216;dreadful&#8217;</a>. <a href='http://httpd.apache.org/test/flood/'>Flood</a> is a better tool.</p>

<p>To duplicate this test, use the supplied configuration files for both httpd and lighttpd. Run ApacheBench like so: <code>ab -n 10000 -c X -H &#39;Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate&#39; -k [http://1.2.3.4/](http://1.2.3.4/)</code></p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t record CPU load during the test. If you want to spend your time doing it, feel free, I would be happy to point to someone elses more complete benchmarks.</p>

<p>Quote from Anonymous :</p>

<p>Max of 75 concurrency? Since gzip is enabled, you&#8217;re testing ~13k files with low concurrency, of course Apache does fine. Your test is flawed and your conclusion is misleading.</p>

<p>I only did 75, since both servers were easily maxing out my 100mbit LAN. If you want realistic testing, you need a very different methodology. To go to higher, I need better hardware, both for the client machine(s) and for my network. Donations Welcome.</p>

<p>Is my test flawed? On so many levels, yes. <strong>My argument is that my benchmark is no more flawed than the benchmarks that lighttpd <a href='http://www.lighttpd.net/benchmark/'>publishes on their website</a>.</strong> I actually believe the dataset that I picked was fairly realistic. (enabling gzip+HTML). I don&#8217;t think my conclusion is misleading. Most people are looking for a magical performance pill. I wager most people can get better performance by improving their PHP/scripting code first.</p>
