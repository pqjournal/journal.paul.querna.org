    <p>Today in Econmics class we were being lectured on Total Profit(TP), Average Costs(AC), Marginal Costs(MC), and Marginal Revenue(MR).</p>

<p>He gave an example, and said that at <strong>quanity 6</strong>, you would have the highest total profit.</p>

<p>However, using simple math (no really, just multiplication and subtraction), you can see that at <strong>quanity 5</strong> you have a higher total profit.</p>

<p>Market Price = $60;</p>

<p>Total Profit = (Market Price - Average Costs) * Quanity</p>

<p>At Q = 5, your Average cost is $50</p>

<p>At Q = 6, your Average cost is $52</p>

<p>Total Profit = ( $60 - $50 ) * 5 = $50</p>

<p>Total Profit = ( $60 - $52 ) * 6 = $48</p>

<p>( $50 &gt; $48 ) = true!</p>

<p>So, the professor was wrong in his example, hey it happens, we are all humans. I raised my hand, and asked if at Q = 5, would you have a higher total profit. I didn&#8217;t use a confronting tone, and I didn&#8217;t even say he was wrong. Instead of investigating my answer, he told the entire class that <strong>I</strong> was wrong, and to please not continue since it would mislead the class. I decided to not make a scene, and talk to him after class. Several other people mumbled how I was right&#8230; sigh.</p>

<p>Talking to him after the class, he would say <em>&#8216;I see how you got there&#8217;</em>, but not that I was right. Oh well. No reeason to make enemies of all my professors.</p>

<p>So here is the point, one of the most important attributes I like to see in people, is the power to admit when you were wrong. Tony Blair <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3718150.stm'>admits he was wrong about Iraq having WMDs</a>, but my economics professor cannot admit he was wrong in a simple example. Heck, last week I <a href='http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=110097570000003&amp;r=1&amp;w=2'>started a thread</a> on dev@httpd suggesting that we have an <em>End Of Life Policy</em> for httpd-2.0.x. It quickly became apparent that no one else agreed with me. No reason to create a flamewar when I was wrong, and I admit that the idea in retrospec does not mesh well with Apache&#8217;s paradign.</p>

<p>It takes a <em>real man</em> to admit when they are wrong.</p>
