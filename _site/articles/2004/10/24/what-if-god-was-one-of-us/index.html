    <p><a href='http://www.carroll.edu/students/studentlife/vp.php'>Dr. Hardwick&#8217;s Blog</a> has become a great source of entertainment lately. He asks the important questions like, What if the <a href='http://www.carroll.edu/students/studentlife/vp.php?id=601'>Condom Rips?</a> (This post was later removed from the public listing), <a href='http://www.carroll.edu/students/studentlife/vp.php?id=587'>Straight Shots on an Empty Stomach</a> and the latest, <a href='http://www.carroll.edu/students/studentlife/vp.php?id=604'>What if god was one of us?</a>.</p>

<p>Quote from Dr. Hardwick&#8217;s Blog:</p>

<p>Would the Divine Presence complain about the food at the St. Thomas Aquinas Dining Hall?</p>

<p>I think the answer is clearly <strong>YES</strong>. The food is that bad. I cannot believe he actually asked that question. It seems that it is on his politcal agenda to spread the belief <a href='http://www.sodexhousa.com/'>that Sodexho</a> is really trying to increase the quality of the food. All I have seen is a an exspensive new awning, and round tables. How about trying harder at making good meals instead?</p>

<p>It is really too bad you cannot post replies or tracebacks to his &#8216;blog&#8217; posts. His whole &#8216;blog&#8217; seems like some excuse to use the <em>hip</em> word &#8216;blog&#8217;. I wish it was a real blog, that dealt with <a href='http://www.helenair.com/articles/2004/10/07/helena_top/a01100704_05.txt'>real issues on campus</a>. The administration has completely stonewalled about the death of <a href='http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=1895476'>Narles Yde-Layn</a>.</p>
