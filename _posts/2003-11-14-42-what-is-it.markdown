I was reading through mod_auth_digest today and found an odd comment:  

  

        /* XXX: WHAT IS THIS CONSTANT? */  

        t.time = 42;  

  

I didn't understand what it mean at all. I looked in the Digest RFC, looked in the Squid Proxies implmentarion of Digest and couldn't figure it out.  

  

I figured it out a couple hours later. 42 is the The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything.  

The Wikipedia has some nice info about it: [http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Answer_to_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything](http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Answer_to_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything)  

Some Apache coders crack me up.  

  

Also found out that Carroll is hiring a "Nicole Swan" to work as a dedicated Coder for the Carroll Website.  

Her blog is over at [http://www.nicoleswan.com/](http://www.nicoleswan.com/)  

  

Hopefully she is pretty good with PHP.  It sounds like we will get todo a complete site redesign from scatch soon.  Should solve many of the problems that the site currently has.
