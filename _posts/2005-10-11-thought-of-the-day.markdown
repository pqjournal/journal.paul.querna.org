Programing itself isn't hard, it just happens to deal with hard problems more often than other tasks.



I don't personally think multi-threaded programing is inherently hard, but put  a hard problem on top of a multi-threaded program, and it is still hard.  I think that many people associate the disasters found in many multi-threaded programs with the hard problems they are trying to solve.  Transference of hardness. Thoughts?
