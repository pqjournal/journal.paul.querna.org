Apache HTTP 2.2.2 is almost out.  You can [download and test it from here](http://httpd.apache.org/dev/dist/).  Hopefully we will get the offical release out by mid week, after it has ran on [www.apache.org](http://www.apache.org/server-status) for another day without problems.


  

  

**Update April 30 2006:**It has [been released](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-announce/200604.mbox/%3c44557B8B.3080609@apache.org%3e).  You can [download it now](http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi).
