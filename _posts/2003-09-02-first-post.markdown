How is this all starting...  

  

I normaly don't like Blogs.  

  

The deal was last week i was renewing this domain(corelands.com) which I use for nothing except email.  It was originaly for a new web based game, but development on that was dropped almost 1 year ago.  I thought I should put somthing up here.  My first idea was to put all my open source software here, which may still happen.  That seemed like it might be enough.  

  

However, for my English 102 class, we have to make some rather lame writing journals.  My second thought was i would get practice writing by using this as a blog, and if even 1 out of ten entries could be used for the writting journal it would be time well spent.  

  

So here i am.. with my own blog. go figure.
