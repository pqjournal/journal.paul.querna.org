  * early morning (3:30am)


  * sea sick. Never really been sea sick before.


  * Will caught a 32lb Salmon:

    * [Ben has way more details.](http://blog.blowery.org/2007/04/20/thursday/)


    * Largest Salmon caught in California so far this season.


    * I'm way too tired to describe it more, but it was fun, and I'm definitely going to do it again.





  * We saw whales too:

Though, the pictures don't do them justice.




  * Didn't get to bed until 3:00am.

    * MySQL-Cluster decided to shirt itself at 10:45pm.


    * NDB Cluster debugging sucks


    * ndb_restore at least works correctly.
      * Although, we had to tweak NoOfFragmentLogFiles to get restore working.


    * I wish we had went with a home built proprietary system, built on top of BerkeleyDB and our existing clustering tech, rather than trying to use MySQL-Cluster. Hindsight is 20/20 of course.


    * Will try to get all of our trace and debug info into a MySQL Bug report or at least a post on the [mysql-clsuter list](http://lists.mysql.com/cluster) next week.
