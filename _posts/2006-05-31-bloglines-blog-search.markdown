[It is live](http://www.bloglines.com/search).




Some highlights:





  
  * [Condoleezza Rice](http://www.bloglines.com/search?q=Condoleezza+Rice&ql=en&s=fr&pop=l&news=m) - Notice the side bar fading in.  Scroll down a litte, and notice the posts **BY** and the posts **ABOUT**.  No else one has anything like that

  
  * Citation Search - For example, look at this [search for people linking to Wingedpig.com](http://www.bloglines.com/search?q=Bcite:wingedpig.com&ql=en&s=f&pop=l&news=m)

  
  * Inline Preview - Click on the ![](http://www.bloglines.com/images/ico_plus.gif) next to a description. Kudos to [Ben](http://blowery.org/blog/) for making it sweet.  Just think about your standard use of a search page. For me at least, I just open 10 links in new tabs in Firefox, and the go to each tab, closing ones I don't find useful content inside.

  
  * [Hourly Top Queries](http://www.bloglines.com/search) - Right there on the search tab.

  
  * No Tags. - Unlike some 'search engines', we don't need tags, just like all modern web searches don't need HTML Meta Tags. RIP Technorati.

  
  * Feeds - RSS Feeds of the search results are built in. You can sub to them from any reader, and see when someone blogs about you.  [Here is mine](http://www.bloglines.com/search?q=paul+querna&ql=en&s=fr&pop=l&news=m&format=rss)

 
  * 5 minute updates - Within 5 minutes of content being found by Bloglines, it will be in the search results.  How often does Bloglines crawl?  Every site, every 30 minutes. In addition, [Bloglines supports pings](http://www.bloglines.com/ping), for even faster updates. Worst case is about 35 minutes, but your average will be much much much lower.




I guess thats all for now.




**EDIT:** Two more things I forgot to mention:





  
  1. Result pages include hotkeys. Just press j for down, and k for up. Not that useful for 10 results per page, but change it to 100, and its very sweet.

  
  2. [Mobile Blog Search](http://www.bloglines.com/mobile).  If you are ever bored with your Treo again, you can now search blogs.
