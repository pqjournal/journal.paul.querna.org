The Economist has a new article up talking [about Ask, Google and Friends](
http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=7064434
).





Quote from [Jim Lanzone](http://sp.ask.com/en/docs/about/management.shtml#jl):




> 
..."we're using search aikido"...




Chris Sherman of [SearchEngineWatch](http://searchenginewatch.com/):




> 
... thinks that Ask is as good as Google for general web searchâ€”but better than Google for finding online maps and images. Ask, he thinks, is therefore starting to resemble Apple in the computer industry...
