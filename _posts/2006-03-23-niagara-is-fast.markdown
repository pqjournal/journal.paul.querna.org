[Colm](http://www.stdlib.net/~colmmacc/about/) has an [awesomr](http://www.awesomr.com/)  article [on benchmarking the Sun Niagara vs ftp.heatnet.ie](http://www.stdlib.net/~colmmacc/2006/03/23/niagara-vs-ftpheanetie-showdown).  

  

The real disappointment is that the [Event MPM](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/event.html) and [Solaris Event Ports](http://partneradvantage.sun.com/protected/solaris10/adoptionkit/tech/tecf.html) can [still panic the kernel](http://www.lethargy.org/~jesus/archives/51-Solaris-10-oops.-oops.-oops.-oops..html).  I have only experenced this bug since before Solaris 10 went GA. Maybe Sun will fix it soon.
