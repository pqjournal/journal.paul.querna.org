Simple Object Access Protocol or [SOAP](http://www.w3.org/TR/soap/) is not simple like it's name implies.  But, Today I bring good news.  I was able to remove the [EasySOAP](http://easysoap.sourceforge.net/) from the Plasma Server Code.  I have replaced it with a very simple HTTP based Authentication system.  I still don't know why [Ubisoft](http://games.slashdot.org/games/03/12/11/0138200.shtml?tid=127&tid=164&tid=185&tid=186&tid=206) had to use SOAP for Authentication.  It still seems like such a huge misapplication of a protocol for a simple task.  
  
As a programer I think [BitTorrent](http://ctorrent.sourceforge.net/) is a pretty cool application and protocol.  However, I don't think its cool that [URU: Path to the Shell](http://www.thepathoftheshell.com/) was available today via BitTorrent, days before it will hit store shelves.  The same thing happened with URU Prime.  Who can I blame?  Do I blame [misapplications of the protocol](http://www.afterdawn.com/news/archive/4498.cfm)? Do I blame the [publishers](http://www.ubi.com/)?  Should I even care that [Cyan's hard work](http://www.cyan.com) is being pirated?
