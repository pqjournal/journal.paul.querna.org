I don't often write about politics, or anything related to it, on my journal.

However, the [SEVEN HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR buyout deal that Henry Paulson, the Secretary of the United States Treasury, is trying to get done](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7634017.stm), is insane.

This isn't Capitalism.

If I didn't believe in Capitalism, I wouldn't be working [at a startup](http://www.joost.com/).

If Joost fails, I don't expect anyone to help me.  I expect it to hurt. But it is my risk to take, why do giant financial companies, who have done apparently stupid things, [get treated differently](http://www.jimjag.com/imo/index.php?/archives/226-Thats-billion-with-a-B.html)?

If Joost is successful, I expect rewards, and this is the basis of any capitalistic system,  but these buyouts are creating a system in which stupid companies can do badly -- and their employees still get rewarded.

I didn't live during the [Great Depression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression).  I don't know how bad it can get. I have lived an 'easy' life in modern America.

But I would rather see another depression than this massive buyout.

Whatever is going on, it is not capitalism, and I am sad to see America going in this direction.
