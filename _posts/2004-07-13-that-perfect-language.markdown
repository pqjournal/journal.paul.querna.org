Having been introduced to [Python](http://www.python.org/) years ago, I keep coming back to it.  
  

For webpages, I used to prefer PHP, but increasingly I am writing native Apache modules and using [XSLT output filters](http://www.outoforder.cc/projects/apache/mod_transform/) to generate my presentation layer.  Writing pages in XML and C can still be painful. Far too painful for most people to use.  
  

For Desktop Applications, I have always advocated C/C++ over Java or anything else.  Its just the best way to make a fast and clean end user application.  But this takes time. Far too much time for most people.  
  

For Shell Scripts, I used to prefer Perl. But honestly, I don't know perl like I used to, and trying to hack around with all those symbols is painful for **me**.  
  

[Some](http://www.mono-project.com) would suggest I should use [C#/.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/).  While I think the language and the platfrom are interesting, they still are not good for most Linux/BSD applications.  
  

So, since I hate everything else, it leaves me with Python.  The weird language that actualy cares about whitespace.  I think that python does not  [improve code quality](http://wingide.com/python/benefits) like some assert.  There are still plenty of [badly designed OOP interfaces](http://newsbruiser.tigris.org/) in Python. Even Python has its faults.  The [Global Interpreter Lock](http://docs.python.org/api/threads.html) still plauges multi-threaded Python enviroments.  While [Boost::Python](http://www.boost.org/libs/python/doc/) isn't Python, it is seriously flawed.  I just spent hours today waiting for those huge C++ templates to compile.  
  
  

Where does this leave me?  There is no prefect language.  They all have flaws.  Perhaps Python is the least flawed of them all, if you don't [embed it](http://www.boost.org/) in [your game engine](http://www.cyanworlds.com). That is about the only conclusion that I can make.  Is there a vast world of [alterantive languages](http://www.ferite.org/) that are perfect?  How does everyone else deal with all these seriously flawed languages?  Why does everyone need to know 5 different scripting languages?
