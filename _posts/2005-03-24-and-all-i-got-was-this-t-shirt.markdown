My [mod_coredumper](http://www.outoforder.cc/projects/apache/mod_coredumper/) Apache Module is currently the Featured Project on [code.google.com](http://code.google.com/).  Even cooler is that Google is sending me a T-Shirt!  
  


Karma points to Google for Open Sourcing coredumper, I was happy just having fun writing mod_coredumper.  Getting a T-Shirt is a nice bonus.
