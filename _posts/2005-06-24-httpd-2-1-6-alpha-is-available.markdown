1 week after 2.1.5, a new alpha is out the door.  Changes include fixing more of the security isseus from the [Watchfire Report](http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/12/1433206) and unlike 2.1.5, this one should compile on Windows.  
  


Download 2.1.6 from:

We really need testing of the [new features](http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.1/new_features_2_2.html), specifically the improved [mod_cache](http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.1/mod/mod_cache.html) and [mod_proxy](http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.1/mod/mod_proxy.html).
