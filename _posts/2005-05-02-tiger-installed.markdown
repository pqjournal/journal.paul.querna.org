Wasnt too painful. I did an upgrade, since I really didn't feel like rebuilding this machine from scratch.  

  

The installer did overwrite my custom /etc/csh.cshrc.  I can't blame them too much, but it would be nice if  it would create a backup of any changed files in /etc/.  

  

So far, it seems that everything else works.
