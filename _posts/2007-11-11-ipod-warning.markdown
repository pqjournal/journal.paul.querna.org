Don't steal music. Thank You Apple for the reminder.

I wonder if new IPhones will include wrappers saying 'Don't [jail break](http://jailbreakme.com/)'.

Well, of course they won't this is Apple we are talking about, it would be more like:


    Don't jail break

    No encarcele la rotura

    Setzen Sie nicht Bruch gefangen

    _壊れ目を拘留してはいけない
