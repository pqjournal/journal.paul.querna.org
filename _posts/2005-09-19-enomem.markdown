Dear Lazy Web,
  
Why does calling `pthread_mutex_lock` and `pthread_mutex_unlock` in a tight loop cause `pthread_create` to error out with ENOMEM?



I could accept something is wrong with my code changes, but by removing the lock/unlock around the shared variables it works correctly.(`*`)  The lock/unlock are in tight loops, but putting them in doesn't change the flow of the program at all.  Any ideas on how this could be causing a `pthread_create` to fail with ENOMEM?



`*` Correctly.  It crashes randomly when starting because the variables aren't locked correctly, but sometimes it finishes.



I would like to blame linux somehow.  I wish this code ran on freebsd so I could.... But testing is for wimps anyways.



Thanks,



Paul
