Wednesday Morning, Fly to Portland.  

Wednesday Afternoon, take shuttle to [Corvallis](http://oregonstate.edu/).  

Thursday, Interview at [OSL](http://osuosl.org/).  

Thursday Night, take shuttle back to Portland.  

Friday Morning, Fly to [Louisville](http://www.slugger.com/).  

Hang out with my Uncles.  

Saturday, Link up with Family, who drove [2123.94 miles](http://www.mapquest.com/directions/main.adp?go=1&do=nw&un=m&cl=EN&ct=NA&rsres=1&1y=US&1a=&1c=Spokane&1s=WA&1z=&1ah=&2y=US&2a=&2c=louisville&2s=KY&2z=&2ah=) from Spokane.  
  

And that is only the first half of the trip.  I think I will post the rest of it later.  If I don't make another post before the 25th, to you, the random internet reader, that I might not even know, I wish a Happy Christmas.
