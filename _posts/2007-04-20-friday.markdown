  * [Feisty Fawn](http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/704tour) installed. [Kernel.org mirror](http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu-releases/feisty/) was giving me 38 mb/s over http.


  * Ripping [Aeon Flux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeon_flux) (not the sucky movie).


  * Watching [Life of Brian](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079470/).


  * Ate the Salmon we [caught yesterday](http://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2007/04/20/thursday) at the Ask.com quarterly All Hands / BBQ in Campbell.  Even with 30 people, we still had Salmon left over.  It was a big fish.


  * Feeling pretty tired. Been a long week.
