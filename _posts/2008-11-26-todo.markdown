(open source) things to do over thanksgiving weekend:



	
  * Improve the Simple MPM.

	
  * Integrate Lua and mod_wombat into httpd trunk.

	
  * Improve the FastCGI Support in httpd turnk.

	
  * Finish my little infrastructure stats & graphs project.


I'll be happy if I make progress on any one of them.....
