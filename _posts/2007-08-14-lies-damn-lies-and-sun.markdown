> Sun continues to contribute both code and development efforts to many Apache projects such as Tomcat, Roller, River (Jini), HTTPD, and Derby.




Sun continuing contributing to Apache [httpd](http://httpd.apache.org/) is news to me. As far as I know, no [Apache HTTPD developer](http://httpd.apache.org/contributors/) is currently employed by Sun.





While [mod_atom](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/What/Technology/mod_atom/) is a cool Apache Module by Tim Bray,  it does not count as `httpd` or [Sun](http://www.sun.com/).





The post by Rich Green contains many other lies, which are discussed [in the comments](http://blogs.sun.com/richgreen/entry/score_another_for_clarity_and#comment-1186774763000), and the [wider internet](http://kasparov.skife.org/blog/2007/08/10/).
