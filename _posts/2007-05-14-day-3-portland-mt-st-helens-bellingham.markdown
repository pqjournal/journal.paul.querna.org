Went up to Mt. St. Helens today.





The Hoffstadt Bridge inside the Mt. St. Helens blast zone:

The next picture is taken from the Coldwater Lake Campground area bellow the ridge visiter center.  Still too many clouds to see the whole mountain:

The Johnston Ridge Observatory isn't quite open until next week, so we had to end our trip at the Coldwater Ridge Visitor Center:

Ended the day with a drive up to Bellingham Washington, so we can head over to Vancouver BC tomorrow....
