  * Bought an [Eve Online](http://www2.eve-online.com/) account.  I did a 14 day trial back in November, and its okay, but I really didn't have any time to play it back then.


  * Finished ["The Diamond Age : Or, a Young Lady's Illustrated Primer (Bantam Spectra Book)" (Neal Stephenson)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=ws%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0553380966%2526tag=ws%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0553380966%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002) a week ago.


  * Just Finished ["A Fire Upon The Deep (Zones of Thought)" (Vernor Vinge)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=ws%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0812515285%2526tag=ws%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0812515285%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002)


  * Currently reading ["Cryptonomicon" (Neal Stephenson)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=ws%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0060512806%2526tag=ws%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0060512806%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002)


  * Writing a toy program, using the [SixApart update stream](http://updates.sixapart.com/), [wxWidgets](http://www.wxwidgets.org/), and [libCURL](http://curl.haxx.se/). Hopefully I will have something to release soon. It currently runs on Win32 and OSX/PPC. I am pretty sure I could get it running on OSX/x86, if anyone wants to buy me an [iMac](http://www.apple.com/imac/). I actually started writing it months ago, but I got busy... and it sat in a subversion repository for a long time.


  * Playing with [re2c](http://re2c.org/) and [Lemon](http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/) for use at work.


  * The [Solr proposal](http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/SolrProposal) looks interesting. I see it as a network service for indexing and searching.  I wish ti wasn't java, but oh well.
