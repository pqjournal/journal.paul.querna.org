Dear Jim Green,  

Your "Talking Fountain" is annoying.  I do not want to hear gurgling water sounds while trying to get a drink of water.  

Thanks,  

-Me  




For those who haven't heard it, the best I can do is show a picture:

Maybe after being stranded at SeaTac for 4 hours, I just lost all appreciation of Art.  It only takes 5 hours to drive from SeaTac to Spokane.  If Alaska Airlines can't fly ontime, driving doesn't sound so bad.
