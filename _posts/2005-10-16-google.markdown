According to Rasmussen, **Google's design philosophy centres on end user loyalty not money**, going beyond the browser's lowest common denominator, to develop simple Web applications that are as dynamic as native applications, and to launch early and often to learn from users.



The real question is, if you have enough end user loyaltly, can you convert that into money?  I think the answer is yes, at least on average.  Make enough cool things, not all of them will be profitable, but enough will.
