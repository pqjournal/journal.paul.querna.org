I started growing corn on my apartment's deck a few weeks ago.  I haven't killed it yet.  Only problem so far is the density -- I planted too much corn in the pots.   I think it will still turn out all right.



While this isn't much corn compared to the [Querna Family Farm](http://maps.ask.com/maps?l=lt%3D43.9047261577%7Clg%3D-93.4695768356%7Cal%3D-1%7Ccx%3D-8711996%7Ccy%3D-4563828%7Czm%3D2%7Cvt%3D1~lt%3D43.89389%7Clg%3D-93.49361%7Cad%3DNew%20Richland%2C%20MN%7Csd%3D0%7Cdm%3D0~#1), I think its a good first crop.


**EDIT:** The link to the Querna Family Farm doesn't work in Safari, since its not supported by [Ask Maps](http://maps.ask.com/). Here is the [Google Maps Link](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=&ie=UTF8&t=h&om=1&ll=43.896903,-93.474169&spn=0.047129,0.103769)
