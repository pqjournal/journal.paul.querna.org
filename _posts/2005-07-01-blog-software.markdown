I am looking for new weblog software.  I would love recommendations.
  
  

My current list of what I want:




  * Open Source. (non-GPL prefered, like BSD or [ASL](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html))


  * Easy & Extendable Modules/Plugins.


  * Something that can run via FastCGI. (I do have PHP via FastCGI too)


  * Uses XML/XSLT. (Not a hard one, but I like to play with adapting projects to using my [mod_transform](http://www.outoforder.cc/projects/apache/mod_transform/))


  * Propper use of HTTP.  This means both [HTTP Caching Headers](http://corelands.com/blog/?postid=76), and [304 Not Modified Support.](http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2002/10/21/http_conditional_get_for_rss_hackers)


  * Under Active Development.


  

I have doen some googling, but when I search for blog software, I mostly get people's blogs about software.  

I have considered writing my own, but that seems like a time sink, and I really don't want to spend time trying to develop community around another project.  
  
I doubt any existing project meets all of my wish list points, and I am willing to send patches to get a project there, but I am having a hard time finding alternatives, besides the big ones like WordPress.
