[Cloudkick](https://www.cloudkick.com/) has been acquired by [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/).

I am extremely excited.

The official post over on [Cloudkick has all the important information](https://www.cloudkick.com/blog/2010/dec/16/acquisition/).

It's been a wild and crazy 17 months since [I joined Cloudkick](http://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2009/07/29/joining-cloudkick/). I have learned a million things from the experience so far, and the adoption of Clouckidk by big customers really has been astounding.

Today I start a new chapter as a [Racker](http://www.rackertalent.com/).
