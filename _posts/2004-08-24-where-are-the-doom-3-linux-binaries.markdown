Quote from TriKster-Abacus- on #icculus.org:

idSoftware had what 4 years to work on this.. I dont understand why not the first week after release
 they couldnt have a dedicated server and a Linux binary


Gosh.  I don't think Mr. TriKster has any clue on what is involved in releasing a game.  Not that I have a ton of experience, but now days I do understand that making a release any game is not just something you do in a weekend. Hell, for many games it could take a couple days just for a build to fully pass QA and begin distribution.  
  

The fact is, any game released for Linux is done out of the goodness of the developer's hearts.  Its not done for a profit.  We all know how well [Loki](http://www.lokigames.com/) did with that profit thing.
