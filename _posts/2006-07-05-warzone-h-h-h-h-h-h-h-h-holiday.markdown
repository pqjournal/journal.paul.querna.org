Up in [Deer Park](http://maps.ask.com/maps?l=lt%3D47.9542802486%7Clg%3D-117.4726009369%7Cal%3D-1%7Ccx%3D-5474620%7Ccy%3D-2553423%7Czm%3D3%7Cvt%3D1~lt%3D47.95428%7Clg%3D-117.4726%7Cad%3DE%20Crawford%20St%2FE%20Crawford%20Ave%20%26%20Margaret%20Ave%2C%20Deer%20Park%2C%20WA%2099006%7Csd%3D0%7Cdm%3D0~#1), it sounded like a war zone last night.
