A shout out to [Ian Holsman](http://www.holsman.net)(dead site?) for providing me with the basis for the [mod_authn_pop3](http://mod-auth.sourceforge.net/docs/mod_authn_pop3/) module.  


I was reading the [Binary Cloud](http://www.binarycloud.com/) website last night, and came upon their [incomplete documentation](http://www.binarycloud.com/documentation/theory/book/).  One part that struck me as important was the discussion on the design of URIs.  



Quote from binarycloud theory section on URIs:


The good: [http://www.example.com/2002/category/design_patterns.html](http://www.example.com/2002/category/design_patterns.html)   

The Bad: [http://www.example.com/?c=category?y=2002?a=design_patterns](http://www.example.com/?c=category?y=2002?a=design_patterns)   

The ugly: [http://www.example.com/article_switcher.php?n=a303?d=2002?aid=3rtg83g3.393s034slak](http://www.example.com/article_switcher.php?n=a303?d=2002?aid=3rtg83g3.393s034slak)   




I must admit, I have done the good, the bad, and the ugly before.  But it doesn't have to be this way.  I think from now on I am commited to always be in the good.
