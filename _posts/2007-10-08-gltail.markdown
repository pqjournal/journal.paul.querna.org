We thought [gltail](http://www.fudgie.org/) sounded pretty cool.   So we hooked it into bloglines.com:[![gltail screenshot](http://journal.paul.querna.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/gltail.png)](http://journal.paul.querna.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/gltail.png)

It worked okay for 1 webserver.  But hooking it up to the entire cluster, it was just a little bit too slow -- drawing a new frame once every 8 seconds.  Time to port it to C :-)
