Last night I was watching [MTV](http://www.mtv.com/).  At Carroll in the Dorms we don't have Cable TV so, a specific show on MTV was rather new to me.  Its called [Video Clash](http://www.mtv.com/onair/video_clash/). The format is nothing new, viewers vote on their favorite music videos, and then they are played.  What I found interesting was the integration of technologies into the show. When they are playing one song, the bottom half the screen is taken up by an area for voting for the next song.  You can vote via SMS or  online, and the percentages change live, on the screen.  Its quite cool.  A button I press online, makes a song get 1% more on the screen, and then if it wins, it will be played next.  A very cool example of web integration.
