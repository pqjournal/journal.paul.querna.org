From [Alpha-Geek.com](http://alpha-geek.com/2006/06/21/bloglines_updates_atom_support):


> I was even able to find a blog of one of their workers – [Paul's Journal](http://journal.paul.querna.org/) – though he doesn't seem to talk about his $job too much.


It is hard to post about [$job](http://www.bloglines.com/), because very little of Bloglines backend  architecture is considered public information. For example, from the companies Blogging Policy Document:


> "It is the Company’s policy that all employees, agents and contractors must keep confidential all information about IAC Search & Media or any IAC company’s operations, products and business activities that has not been made public ..."


Which I believe pretty much includes how our custom distributed filesystem works, or how Bloglines is scaling (other than saying that [memcached](http://www.danga.com/memcached/) is [awesomr](http://www.awesomr.com/), which is public), or even the details behind our [new Atom Parser](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/06/21/Forward-Motion).  It isn't something I am too concerned about really, you don't see anyone from Google posting the technical details behind [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader).  It is just a standard in so many coporations to keep information close.

As Requested in the $job Blogging Policy Document: "The views expressed in this blog are my own and do no necessarily reflect the views of my employer."
