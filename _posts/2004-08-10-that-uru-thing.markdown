Last Friday, [Cyan](http://www.cyanworlds.com/) released [Untï¿½l Uru](http://plasma.cyanworlds.com).
It felt pretty good to get somthing out that is almost all my work.  I couldn't of done it without [Grey Dragon's](http://www.thegreydragon.com/) help, but I did all the technical work.  
  

The reaction in the community has been pretty cool to watch.  I know how many people felt after Live was killed.  I am just happy I have been able to give some of Live back to them.
