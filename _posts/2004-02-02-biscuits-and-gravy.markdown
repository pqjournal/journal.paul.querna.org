I was watching the [Super Bowl]() Today.  

The game was [pretty good](http://drudgereport.com/mattjj.htm). Better than I expected infact.  [IBM](http://www.ibm.com) even had a cool Linux Advert.  
  

By the time the game was over, the [Rot](http://www.carroll.edu/students/menu.php) had already closed.  
  

Finnaly got to eat some Biscuits and Gravy around midnight.  Bill, Will, Won Ho and I went to the [Country Harvest](http://goldwest.visitmt.com/listings/9955.htm). Hot Dam. Those Biscuits and Gravy were good!
