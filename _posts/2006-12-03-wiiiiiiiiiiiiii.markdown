I went to the local [Target](http://maps.ask.com/maps?l=lt%3D37.33934%7Clg%3D-121.90421%7Cal%3D-1%7Ccx%3D-11362296%7Ccy%3D-3756514%7Czm%3D2%7Cvt%3D1~#1) at about 5:00am this morning, and was 7th in line for the Wii.  This store had 26 to release today.




Now it's time for part two of my Wii-adventure; **The search for controllers**. So far every store I've contacted has been completely out of controllers :(
