[iBloglines](http://i.bloglines.com/), now has more features. The [Bloglines Blog](http://www.bloglines.com/about/news#137) has more details.




Geoff has [a comparison of iBloglines to NewsGator's iPhone site](http://mipsisrisc.com/rambling/?p=26).




It turns out, [even Google Reader users](http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Labs-Reader/msg/dd02119094124951) like our iPhone site. Hurrah.
