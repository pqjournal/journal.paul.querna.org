[JBoss Web Server](http://www.jboss.com/products/jbossweb) came out.  Here is a quote from the product page:


> JBoss Web is built on Apache Tomcat and includes Apache Portable Runtime (APR) and Tomcat native technologies to achieve scalability and performance characteristics that match and **exceed** the Apache HTTP Server.



I laughed. "Exceed". [Thats Funny](http://www.stdlib.net/~colmmacc/2006/03/23/niagara-vs-ftpheanetie-showdown/).



  

  



Google Released its [Calendar Application](http://calendar.google.com/). It has what they are calling ['Private Address' XML Feeds](http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?answer=37106&ctx=sibling), which publish your entire calendar.  The problem is, that most Feed Readers like [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/) and [MyYahoo](http://my.yahoo.com/) consider content public by default.  Currently, the only way to make content _private_ is to use [HTTP Authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_authentication_scheme), which prevents all search engines from making it public.  While this oversight has been made by others, like [TadaList](http://www.tadalist.com/), they also made one other horrible mistake.  They don't support [Conditional GETs](http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2002/10/21/http_conditional_get_for_rss_hackers) of their XML Feeds.  I laughed.  I guess Google is just willing to waste their bandwidth for now.




  



Not as funny to me, but Tim has done  [a great post](http://www.oreillynet.com/onjava/blog/2006/04/red_hat_buys_jboss_my_mixed_re.html) on the [recent Redhat purchase of JBoss](http://www.regdeveloper.co.uk/2006/04/10/fleury_redhat_critic/).  It is interesting to ponder the value of the Apache [HTTP Server Project](http://httpd.apache.org/), but I think at some point, you can't get caught up in silly things like that.  You need to do open source for yourself first.  If other people use it... thats just a bonus.
