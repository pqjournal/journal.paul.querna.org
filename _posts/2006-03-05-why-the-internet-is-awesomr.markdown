Video content on the internet is growing every day.  It is kind of neat.  I am still not sure I like video... compared to text.  It has lots of attributes that make it very inefficient and hard to use.  Indexing it is hard. Searching it is hard too.  Consuming it takes more time.  Text on the other hand is easier to index, and you can consume it as fast as you can read it.....  I guess there is a place for each in the future.
