I received an Invitation of Commit Access from the [HTTP Server Project](http://httpd.apache.org/) from the HTTPd [PMC](http://www.apache.org/foundation/roles.html#pmc) earlier today.  
  

I hope to push for a 2.2 release soon.  Having features in 2.1.0 sit there for 2 years is worthless and hurts development. More to come on this.
