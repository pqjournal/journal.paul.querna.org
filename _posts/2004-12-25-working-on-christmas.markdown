Bah, Humbug!  
  


I just deleted 120 new blog spams on Christmas night. This is horrible. Can't the Spam Bots give the world one day to relax?  
  


I would hate to use [picture verification](http://www.phpnoise.com/tutorials/1/2) to block the bots, as these have horrible [usability implications](http://www.w3.org/WAI/).  I think a better alternative is to ask simple math questions, like _2+2=?_.  I am not sure if these user verifications are the best, as the spam bots will keep getting smarter. It is just 
[another arms race](http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A34439-2003Jun26).  
  


I have been thinking of plugging my blog comments into [SpamAssassin](http://spamassassin.apache.org/) or [another bayes type](http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/) checker.  These all see mostly targeted at E-Mail, but I assume with some small scripting magic, they could filter my blog comments.  
  


Baring those Evil Spammers, I wish everyone a Happy Holiday Season :)  Outside of [New Richland Minnesota](http://www.cityofnewrichlandmn.com/) I am having an awesome time visiting with my entire familiy.  This evening we had upwards of 25 people in the house, with laughter and smiles all around. Everything is perfect, except for the temperature outside, which is a brisk **-10 �F** or **-23 �C** for my non-fahrenheit viewers.
