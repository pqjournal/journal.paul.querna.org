MySQL HTTP Engine: [Crazy Crazy Crazy](http://krow.livejournal.com/507091.html).

    * But, this is an indication to me, that you really shouldn't be writing SQL.  SQL has its places, but I'm starting to believe that place is not the web application.




  * Lunch: Left at Albuquerque. Margarita=Yum. Not as good as El Buro [last night](http://blog.blowery.org/2007/04/18/tuesday/), but still good.

_"Marigage isn't forever, its just until its done."_






  * Going to use libevent for an HTTP Client and Server.  Its definitely missing features, but shouldn't be too hard to get it where we want it.



  * Dinner: Outback. Steak. Yum.

    * Discussed [Eve Online](http://www.eve-online.com/). And Housing.


    * My new plan is to get 5 million dollars, and a Pony.

      * 5 Million for the House, to have a place to put the $1000 Pony.



  * Need to get up at oh-shirt-early in the morning tomorrow, to go Salmon Fishing. Woooo.
