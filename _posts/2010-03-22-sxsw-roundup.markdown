I did a [ post about the first day at SXSW](http://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2010/03/13/sxsw-day-1/), but I failed to post any others for the following 9 days.  I also made 0 tweets, but successfully checked into a total of 4 places on foursquare.

I am absolutely terrible at this Blogging/Twitter/foursquare thing.

Anyways, SXSW was a blast.  Austin is a great city, and everyone that went there with Cloudkick had a great time.

The high and low lights:



	
  * Most Memorable: [Get Low](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194263/) - Bill Murray, Robert Duvall, and Sissy Spacek all came to this screening.  Did the Q&A afterwords, and Bill Murray great.  Movie while it has some humor building up to the final scene thanks to Bill Murray, was really all about great acting by Robert Duvall.

	
  * They let you Bar tend? - A [Kamikaze](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamikaze_%28cocktail%29) does not include cranberry juice.  I know there are a ton of bars (and therefore you need a ton of bar tenders) in Austin, but really?

	
  * Wow: [Werner Vogel](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/) at the [Big Data Cluster meetup](http://datacluster.infochimps.org/).  Great job by [Stu Hood](http://twitter.com/stuhood) to refute some of his silliness, and it was good to meet more Apache Cassandra developers, like the current PMC chair [Jonathan Ellis](http://spyced.blogspot.com/) in person.

	
  * New Favorite Band: [Murder by Death ](http://murderbydeath.com/)- I loved the combination of Electronic Cello, with the deep voice and great songs.

	
  * Best non-BBQ Food: [Koriente](http://www.koriente.com/) - Nice and Fresh food, and of course bubble tea.  Not that we went to many non-BBQ places this week, but this restaurant was a pleasant surprise and break from BBQ.

	
  * Best BBQ: Not sure, we went to many BBQs spots, including Stubbs, Iron Works, and Salt Lick.  Salt Lick I guess was a cool experience, but I did enjoy the night [Ryan Phillips](http://twitter.com/rphillips) brought over Rudy's to our Roof Deck.

	
  * Speakin of Roof Decks:  Wow, we got really lucky with the place we rented for the week, a roof deck overlooking the entire downtown.

	
  * Best Pass: I think I enjoyed the Film pass by far, the Interactive... I honestly went to like 3 sessions.  Music was good too, but I felt like I don't get to see many movies, while music is easier to experience over the internet without a 2 hour time sink.
