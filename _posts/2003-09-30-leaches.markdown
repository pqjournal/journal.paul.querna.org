Leaches are parasites that suck off their victims blood, taking what is not theirs.  In todays world, many people embody the same tactic of leaching off their so called friends.  A person in my hall, while he is the nice guy stereotype is a perfect example of a modern leach.  If you order Pizza, he will wander into your room and ask for a piece.  If you are trying to study in your room, he will drop by with a lame joke.  If you are trying to write   Its not that I hate people in general, its that this one person constantly takes, without giving.  Real friends know when to share, when to join a conversation, and when to leave a person alone.  Leaches don't have any of these traits, they don't share, they don't gracefully join in a conversation and most of all they do not know when they are not wanted.  It is difficult for me to tell these leaches to go away, it isn't in my nature to be mean to anyone.  My only solution has been to keep open, and hope that the leach can learn, and become a true friend in the future.
