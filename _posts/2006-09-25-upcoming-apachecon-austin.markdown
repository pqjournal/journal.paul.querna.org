In just a couple weeks, I'll be at [ApacheCon  US 2006](http://www.us.apachecon.com/) in [Austin Texas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas).  I am not [giving a presentation](http://www.us.apachecon.com/html/speakers.html) this year. I am hoping to find some time to hack on the [Event MPM](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/event.html).  Maybe even have the time to finish the Async Read/Write stuff that [Brian was working on](http://www.brianp.net/b/initial-nonblocking-read-implementation-for-apache-23) earlier this year.
