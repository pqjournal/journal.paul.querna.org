Ugh. Long Month. Tired. Short sentences coming:



Currently at [ApacheCon](http://www.apachecon.com/2005/US/index).



I gave my What's new in httpd 2.2 talk. Slides [are available](http://www.outoforder.cc/presentations/).



I have been invited / voted to become an [ASF member](http://www.apache.org/foundation/members.html).



Been insanely busy with $[work](https://www.bloglines.com/).   Our currently system is overloaded. Hopefully we will [finish our colo move](http://www.siliconbeat.com/entries/2005/08/05/bloglines_issues.html) soon.



[Wrote a patch](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/200512.mbox/%3c439C6C07.9030904@force-elite.com%3e) to use [apr_memcache](http://www.outoforder.cc/projects/libs/apr_memcache/) as a [session storage method for mod_ssl](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslsessioncache) at the [Hackathon](http://www.sauria.com/blog/2005/12/12#1439) this weekend.
