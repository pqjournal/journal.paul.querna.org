Getting [older](http://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2006/12/21/happy-birthday/)...

Really getting tired this year.  Since ApacheCon in Atlanta on November 11th, I haven't been home in San Jose for more than 6 days straight.

Thankfully, I have the next 2 weeks in Spokane at my parent's house to chill for a bit.
