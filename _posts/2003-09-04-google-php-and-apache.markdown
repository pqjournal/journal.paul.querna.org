[Google](http://www.google.com/linux), the god of searching always continues to amaze me.  While doing my daily troll over [slashdot](http://www.slashdot.org) I found that google is also a calculator!  Try it out.  


[100 days in seconds](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&safe=off&q=100+days+in+seconds&btnG=Google+Search)  


[`53*100`](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&safe=off&q=53*1000&btnG=Google+Search)  

  

Today I also was making a [Poll System](http://force-elite.com/~chip/carroll/student_poll/student_poll/) for [Carroll](http://www.carroll.edu) I did it in [OOP PHP](http://www.php.net/oop). I was amazed at how much faster I was able to code it now that I have recently being doing much more C++.  PHP seemed like such a breaze.
  

  

In other news, I submited a Patch to [APR](http://apr.apache.org) for [apr_reslist](http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/apr-util/misc/apr_reslist.c)  
  

Otherwise, I have just been hanging around in the dorm. Hurrah.
