For a couple months I have been helping [urkle](http://www.outoforder.cc/) on [ #apache-modules](http://www.freenode.net) with his [mod_ftpd](http://www.outoforder.cc/projects/apache/mod_ftpd.html).  I even wrote a [libdbi](http://libdbi.sf.net) backend for it.  
  


Urkle's module is the first Apache 2 module that implments a non-HTTP based protocol completely.  Mod_FTPD has many features of other [FTP servers](http://www.pureftpd.org) that are several years old, but it has these in the span of a couple months because of its re-use of the Apache 2.0 Core.  
  


I have also been hacking on [Ferite](http://www.ferite.org).  I have added [libcurl](http://curl.haxx.se/) [bindings](http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/ferite/modules/curl/) and am starting work on [GTK 2.0 Bindings](http://www.gtk.org).  
  


Today I also played with making [mod_autoindex](http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_autoindex.html) output pure XHTML using lists and formating via CSS instead of a giant PRE tag.  
  


Maybe I should update this more often instead of one big mind dump.
