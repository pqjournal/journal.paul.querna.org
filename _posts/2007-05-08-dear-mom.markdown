Dear Mom,




I know [you like making more artsy quilts](http://karenquerna.blogspot.com/), but could you make me a [pirate quilt](http://www.jandofabrics.com/proddetail.asp?prod=pir00010)?




Your Loving Son,




Paul




PS: Yes this is supposed to be some kind of joke, but a Pirate quilt would be sweet. [Yarrrrr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster#Pirates_and_global_warming)!
