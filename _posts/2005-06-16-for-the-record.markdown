I noticed that the [Cherokee Web Server](http://www.0x50.org) [added support](http://www.mail-archive.com/cherokee@lists.alobbs.com/msg00070.html) for [Solaris 10 Event Ports](http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5168/6mbb3hrfg?a=view).  They thought [Cherokee was the first open source server](http://www.mail-archive.com/cherokee@lists.alobbs.com/msg00071.html) to add support, but I beat them by 6 months. Back in [November of 2004](http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi?rev=106156&view=rev) I added support to APR/HTTPD.  
  

Little Dance.  
  

I won.
