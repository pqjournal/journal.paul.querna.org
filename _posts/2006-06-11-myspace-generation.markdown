There were [350 graduates](http://www.spokesmanreview.com/news/live/body.asp?ID=library\grad03\grads-mead) from [Mead High School](http://mhs.mead.k12.wa.us/)`(*)` in 2003.I was one of them. There are [are 106 MySpace profiles](http://search.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=find&circuitaction=search&searchType=network&f_first_name=&InterestType=SCH-REF&f_search_criteria=99933&first=No&YearType=graduated&GradYear=2003&StartYear=0&EndYear=0&Major=&Minor=&Clubs=&noDetail=0&Photos=1&Gender=2&Greek1=99&Greek2=99&Greek3=99&DeptID=0&CourseNumber=0&AgeFrom=16&AgeTo=63&Page=1) that claim to be graduates from that year too. 30% penetration in a group of 20-21 year olds.




I don't have a MySpace profile.  Maybe I am missing something important.


  



`(*)` Shocking side note, the [Mead High School website](http://mhs.mead.k12.wa.us/) is still running same stuff I coded for them in 2001.
