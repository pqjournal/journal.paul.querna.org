Crossing the Border: We apparently were suspicious, and the booth guy sent us inside for another interview, but the guy inside was much nicer, and we were on our way pretty quickly.

We went out to [Stanley Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Park), which was very nice. This picture is the Lions Gate Bridge from Prospect Point:

After lunch in the Park, we went to the [Vancouver Aquarium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Aquarium), also inside Stanley Park:

They of course had jellyfish:

And the [famous hand-holding](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epUk3T2Kfno) Otters:

And we saw the Beluga Whales:

After the Aquarium we went downtown, and found a nice spot along the water to chill.  Vancouver is an awesome city.
