So, I didn't rush to get one on launch day; But enough people have said good things about it, and it doesn't look like a flop, so today I went up to the [Valley Fair Apple Store](http://www.apple.com/retail/valleyfair/) in Santa Clara at about 4pm.






Walked in, and it was crazy busy, people all huddled around the demo units. I figured they were sold out, but asked an employee, and he said to just go to the checkout.  And so now I have an iPhone.





The migration was painless. I ported my existing Cingular/ATT account.  When I originally signed up with Cingular, it took 3 hours to activate the phone in a store.  With Apple, I did it form home, in 3 minutes, via iTunes.  It is about time cell phones stopped sucking.
