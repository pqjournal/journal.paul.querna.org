On August 10th, I'll be on the panel about Blog Spam for [AIRWeb 2006](http://airweb.cse.lehigh.edu/), which is part of [SIGIR 2006](http://www.sigir2006.org/) at the [UW Campus](http://www.washington.edu/) in Seattle.




I think my perspective will be signifigantly different from the other panelists; Because Bloglines has a signifigant enough user base, we know what people actually read, and people generally don't subscribe to Spam Feeds. The next question will be of course, how does Bloglines know if it is a real human subscribing to a feed....




Too bad the [Mariners are away in Texas](http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/schedule/index.jsp?c_id=sea&m=8&y=2006) when I'll be there.
