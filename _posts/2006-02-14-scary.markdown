It is scary [when people you don't know, take pictures of your office](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/road-trip-ask-jeeves-in-campbell/).  If you want to come inside sometime just drop me a line.  But taking pictures like some freako stalker makes me scared.



P.S.: We all use the back door to get in.  Only packages come in the front. Next time, walk around to the back....
