I am fed up with people creating LIBRARIES and then licening them under the GPL.  Please use the LGPL. Thanks.  
  

Todays disapointment was in regards to the [Xapian search engine library](http://www.xapian.org/).  
  
  

I am still trying to find a full text search library to embed with mod_mbox -- [Lucene4c](http://incubator.apache.org/lucene4c/) isn't 'there' yet.  
  

It is just frustrating to be working on an **open source** project, and be unable to use what looks like a cool **open source** library.
