Kevin Burton doesn't have enough money for server(s).  So, for fund raising, he is offering you the privilege of testing his product, [if you pay $20](http://www.feedblog.org/2005/10/20_gets_you_a_t.html).



I think this has a few major problems, that whole paying for servers idea.  First off, you can't buy that many severs, unless lots of people pay you $20.  Second, if your service needs so many servers **now** before it is public, I think you should rethink your service.  If you can't launch a service on a few machines or even a single machine, I have little faith in your service scaling out.



Since I want to see if anyone is crazy enough to pay for a beta, I am offering an **AMAZING DEAL**.  Buy me things off [my Amazon wish list](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html/ref=cm_wl_sortbar_v_Nor/103-3003405-7603806?%5Fencoding=UTF8&filter=all&sort=priority&type=wishlist&id=1QHCYROTY23AA&layout=standard&reveal=unpurchased&page=1), and I will give you the privilege of testing [Apache HTTPD 2.1.8-BETA](http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/Announcement2.1-beta.html).  If enough people buy me stuff, I might **think** about working on a 2.1.9-BETA.  Look at [my list](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html/ref=cm_wl_sortbar_v_Nor/103-3003405-7603806?%5Fencoding=UTF8&filter=all&sort=priority&type=wishlist&id=1QHCYROTY23AA&layout=standard&reveal=unpurchased&page=1), you don't even need to spend $20 like some of the [competing betas.](http://www.feedblog.org/2005/10/20_gets_you_a_t.html)  And when this is all over, you will even get the [source code](http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/).
