[David Dederer](http://www.bloglines.com/search?q=David+Dederer&ql=en&s=fr&pop=l&news=m), formally from [Presidents of the United States of America](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Presidents_of_the_United_States_of_America_%28band%29), was one of the most interesting talks this morning.  He explained how artists really make money, and all the points where the record companies take a cut.

Sen. John Edwards.  [Net Neutrality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_neutrality) and the lack of balls in the democratic party was discussed.
  
It was okay, but, I'm holding my breath until real action is taken. [Search on John Edwards](http://www.bloglines.com/search?q=John+Edwards&ql=en&s=fr&pop=l&news=m).

A blurred picture of the just launched [BlueDot](http://bluedot.us/friends/dots).  I thought it was pretty stupid, and the blue balls were just a 'we have VC money to waste' statement to me. [Search for BlueDot](http://www.bloglines.com/search?q=bluedot&ql=en&s=fr&pop=l&news=m).



Oh yeah, and Doug, Robyn, and I got up on stage for 30 minutes and [talked about the 'next big idea' for aggregators](http://www.blogaholics.ca/archives/2006/06/news-aggregators-gnomedex-60.html).  I think the session went really well.  We actually got some clapping, and [we gave away a huge bottle of wine](http://www.flickr.com/photos/laughingsquid/178672669/).



Laughing Squid has a [huge set of photos posted](http://laughingsquid.com/2006/06/30/gnomedex-6-photos/).



Time for bed. Day Two starts early tomorrow.
