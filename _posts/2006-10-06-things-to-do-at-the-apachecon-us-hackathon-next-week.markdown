Since [Garrett did it](http://asdf.blogs.com/asdf/2006/10/things_to_do_at.html), here is my list:







  1. Try to commit the recent mod_cache patches. [1](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/200610.mbox/%3cPine.GSO.4.64.0610052158330.28402@kleopatra.acc.umu.se%3e) [2](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/200609.mbox/%3c20060920023353.514118000@haxent.com.br%3e)


  2. Crazy [Lua](http://www.lua.org/)+[httpd](http://httpd.apache.org/) integration plan. Something kind of like [mod_magnet for ligty]( http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/wiki/Docs:ModMagnet), but also replacing the httpd config subsystem.


  3. A new project to build an Automatic Partitioned Replicated Object Storage system built on top of [BerkeleyDB](http://www.sleepycat.com/products/bdb.html).


  4. A new project to build a [DFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_file_system) that is a cross between [MogileFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MogileFS) and what [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/) has built internally.




Being realistic, I think I can do #1 without a problem.  The rest are turning into lots of talk, and far off goals.  Maybe I should just concentrate on one of them and get it to a usable state.....
