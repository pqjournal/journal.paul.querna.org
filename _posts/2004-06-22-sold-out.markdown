I was going to see [Dodgeball!](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364725/) at 7:30, and the 7:30 showing was **sold out**. This is on a Tuesday night in Spokane Washington.  What the Heck!  
  

A Movie in Spokane Sold Out? On a Tuesday night on a nice summer day?????  
  

Well, I got tickets for the 9:45 showing.. I have always wondered about using online movie ticket websites like [Fandango](http://www.fandango.com/) or [MovieTickets.com](http://www.movietickets.com/).  But two things keep me from doing that:


  * Movies are never sold out in Spokane(1)

  * I don't want to pay extra to order movie tickets online.


  
  


(1) - Except for Tuesday nights at 7:30 and on Opening Nights of a movie like [Lord of the Rings](http://www.lordoftherings.net/)
