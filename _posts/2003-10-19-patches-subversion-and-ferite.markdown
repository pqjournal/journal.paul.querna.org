Today got around to putting all my recent patches into one place:  

[http://force-elite.com/~chip/patches/](http://force-elite.com/~chip/patches/)  

  

I also moved ccSite to [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) instead of CVS.  

SVN has been working pretty good so far. No real complants.  

  

Been playing alot with [Ferite](http://www.ferite.org/) lately.
I fixed up some [patches](http://force-elite.com/~chip/patches/ferite/add-pthread-events/) to add an Event Class to Ferite.
I think i will try embeding Ferite instead of PHP.  PHP just has too many problems with multi-threaded code.
