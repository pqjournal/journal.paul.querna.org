So, this isn't one of those theoretical 'easy enough for your mother to use' questions.



My Mother wants to have a blog.  She wants to post pictures of her quilts and stuff like that. (Yes, she is a quilter!)



So, I have looked at setting up [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/), or another instance of [Typo](http://www.typosphere.org/) for her, and that is the easy part.



What I really want is a [WYSIWYG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) desktop editor for her.  So she can insert pictures, and do all the stuff like she is used to in Windows Applications, press publish, and a whole bunch of magic happens.



I personally use [Ecto](http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/) on my mac, and love it.  If she had a Mac, I would buy Ecto for her too.  Damn, if she only had a Mac, it could integrate with [iPhoto](http://www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto/) and [iWeb](http://www.apple.com/ilife/iweb/) and it would be so much easier.  Maybe I will just drop-ship her a Intel [mac mini](http://www.apple.com/macmini/), when they come out with one.



Does anyone have any recommendations on either a hosted service, or a windows desktop application that makes it damn simple to make blog posts with images?
