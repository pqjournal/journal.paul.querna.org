I couldn't think of a good title for this post, but earlier today i had watched a bunch of [Celebrity Jeopardy](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rrosanel/SNLCharacters.htm) from [SNL](http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/).  
  


Also got a good quote from my english prof this morning:


Quote from Dr. Conover:

English is a pain in the Butt, Im Sorry.


I agree completely! English sucks. Everyone should talk to each other in [Java](http://java.sun.com) (hey, that would be cool, a completely cross culture language. As long as Sun wants to port it and then [license binaries](http://www.freebsd.org/java/) )  
  

The written english language is dreadful. Its a horrible mesh of old and new words, with rules that don't any sense. It needs some [serious refactoring](http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Programming/Methodologies/Refactoring/).  
  


Heading back to home to [Spokane](http://www.spokanecity.org/) next for Thanksgiving break. It will be good to see the whole family again. Im guessing everyone at [Cyan](http://www.cyanworlds.com) won't be working the days I am there. But I should try to hook up with some of them.
