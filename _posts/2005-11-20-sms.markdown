I switched to Cingular for my cell phone in August, and I have been mostly happy with it.



Today I got an SMS Message 67 minutes late.  Has anyone else had this kind of problem with [Cingular](http://www.cingularme.com/do/public?l=en-US&v=cingular)?



It doesn't give me faith in them as a reliable service.  Unfortunately, the SMS was for a server restarting at $[work](http://www.bloglines.com/).
