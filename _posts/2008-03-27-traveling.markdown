I spent the last week or so in New York City, at the Joost office there.  I kinda forgot to post anything.  This was the first time I had been to NYC, and it was a fun trip.  Not sure I would ever want to live in NYC.




Returning to San Jose, was not so fun. 




Yesterday, [American Airlines cancelled a couple hundred flights due to problems with their MD-80s](http://news.google.com/news?um=1&tab=ln&hl=en&q=american+airlines+md-80&btnG=Search+News).




I was originally going LGA -> ORD -> SJC.  

The ORD -> SJC leg got cancelled.  

They re-routed me LGA -> DFW -> SJC.  

When I landed in DFW, the flight to SJC had been cancelled.  

There were no more flights to SJC.  

The flights to SFO and OAK were all fully booked.  






I luckly got on the top of the standby list to OAK, and got on that flight. 




My checked bag however, is somewhere between New York and California, and American Airlines doesn't know where it is yet. Sigh.
