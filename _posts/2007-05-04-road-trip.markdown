I'm taking a week off, and going on a road trip.




Somehow, I convinced [Striker](http://interhact.net/) to go with me, and he hasn't done anything on the west coast before.





Currently the road trip has 3 constraints:






  * Leave San Jose on Friday, May 11th.


  * Seattle Mariners vs. Angels Baseball - 
[Safeco Field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safeco_Field), Wednesday, May 16th, 7:05 PM


  * Back to San Jose by Sunday, May 20th.




I need **your help**.  What should I do, what places should I visit, and what routes should I take to get there?




I have a couple things I'm considering right now:






  * [Powell's Books](http://www.powells.com/) in Portland. Last time I was there, I left with 8 books -- but I knew I had to fly home.  With a Car, this could be a very expensive stop.


  * [Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument](http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/mshnvm/) - Never been there... Seems like it would be a good place to spend an afternoon, and maybe go on a short hike, depending on the weather.


  * Maybe head up to BC, and go to the [Capilano Suspension Bridge](http://www.capbridge.com/)


  * Other stuff around Vancouver? Victoria?


  * I want to fit in a couple days after the baseball game to head over to Spokane. On the way over, I was thinking I could do a tour of [Columbia River Dans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectric_dams_on_the_Columbia_River).  There are 14 or so... Could make a nice flickr gallery.


  * General Seattle Stuff. Space Needle, Ferries, etc.
