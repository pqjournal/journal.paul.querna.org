Yesterday, Apple approved the Joost Application for the IPhone.

[Apple Store Link](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=295977505&mt=8).

The Joost Application is something I helped prototype, and wrote most of the server side support, although I was busy with other things and haven't worked on it recently, and I'm glad it is now released to the public.

It isn't perfect, as some of the reviews have said, we are doing our best with the APIs that Apple provides, but the Video Player has some pretty big bugs we do our best to work around, but I hope Apple significantly improves MPMoviePlayerController with another firmware release.
