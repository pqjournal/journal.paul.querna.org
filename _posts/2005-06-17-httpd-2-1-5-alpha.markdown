Apache has a 2.1.5-ALPHA posted at:  

[http://httpd.apache.org/dev/dist/](http://httpd.apache.org/dev/dist/)
  

Change Log:  

[http://httpd.apache.org/dev/dist/CHANGES_2.1](http://httpd.apache.org/dev/dist/CHANGES_2.1)  
  

We really need people to test the alphas.  I would like to push for a new 2.2.0 stable branch soon, and the more testing we get in alpha means the less bugs we find after going stable....
