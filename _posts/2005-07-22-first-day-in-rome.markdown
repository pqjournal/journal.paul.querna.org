We started a walking tour from the Spanish Steps:

It seems like the best method of transportation is a motorcycle, at least inside the city:

Okay, now to the coolest part of today. The Pantheon. It is truly amazing that people thousands of years ago were able to build structures like this.  The dome from the inside is mind boggling huge:

The apparatus on the left side is used to help clean the dome.  The Pantheon just feels magnificent on the inside.

We finished up walking thru the Jewish Ghetto, and then along the Tiber River:
