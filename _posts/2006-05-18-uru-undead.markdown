Its interesting how a summer project that I did, [Until Uru](http://plasma.cyanworlds.com/), has turned out this way.  I want to write up my thoughts about Uru. I never could of predicted the chain of events that led to this, after Ubi killed Uru the first time.
  
  

But I don't have time today to explain all my feelings on Uru; I am giving a presentation today in [Oakland](http://maps.ask.com/maps?l=lt%3D37.8036998234%7Clg%3D-122.2750237584%7Cal%3D-1%7Ccx%3D-45587433%7Ccy%3D-15244489%7Czm%3D0%7Cvt%3D1~lt%3D37.80387%7Clg%3D-122.27469%7Cad%3D555%2012th%20St%2C%20Oakland%2C%20CA%2094607%7Csd%3D0%7Cdm%3D0~#1) today, and need to get on the [BART](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BART) to avoid the traffic.
