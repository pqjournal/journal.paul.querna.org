This is a graph of the Apache.org Public Mailing lists Posts:


[![](http://corelands.com/~chip/mbox-graph-2006-11.png)](http://corelands.com/~chip/mbox-graph-2006-11.png)




Every dot on there is the number of posts per month. We started with in [699 in March 1995](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/199503.mbox/browser), and now have [73,473 in the month of November 2006](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/)





I made the graph this morning with a little [mod_mbox](http://httpd.apache.org/mod_mbox/)+ python + [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/)
magic.




EDIT: See also [Ken's graphs of ASF committers and members](http://ken.coar.org/burrow/index?entry=1929;comments=true) from earlier this year. Yup. The ASF is growing, quickly.
