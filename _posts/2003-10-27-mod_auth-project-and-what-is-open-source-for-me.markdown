I have setup a new [SourceForge](http://www.sf.net) Project for [Authentication Modules](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mod-auth)  

  

Lots of little changes to mod_authn_dbi have happend in the last few days. One thing I have been working on was moving it to autoconf/automake and family.  Well, I am now more resolved than ever in my hate for those projects and my love for [SCons](http://www.scons.org/).
  

  

Been getting alot of help from [Axel Grossklaus](http://sourceforge.net/users/honx/).  Its been a cool feeling to have someone external to my project helping out.  I think this is the first time I have had someone I didn't have a previous relationship with help me on a project.  That is why I love open source software. Anyone, Anywhere can help, and it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside.
