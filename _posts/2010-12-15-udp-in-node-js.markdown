At Node.js Camp yesterday on UDP in Node.js, and the video got recorded on ustream.

Slides for the talk are posted [here](http://paul.querna.org/slides/nodejs-udp-nodecamp2010.pdf).

All of the example code is posted up on github [here](https://github.com/pquerna/node-examples/tree/master/udp).

Happy to answer any questions about node and udp here too.

PS, thanks to everyone at Joyent for making the Node.js Camp happen, it was a great little conference!
