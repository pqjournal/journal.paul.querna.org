I sat down yesterday with Cote from [Redmonk](http://www.redmonk.com) here in Atlanta during ApacheCon. He recorded a "make all" podcast all about Libcloud, the Cloud, and Cloudkick:


> Iâ€™d gotten quick briefing from him yesterday and was interested in talking more about the libcloud framework which is trying to wrap one API around all the different clouds out there. We also talk about the kinds of applications Paul has been seeing people put on the cloud and also the monitoring and management services that CloudKick providers.
