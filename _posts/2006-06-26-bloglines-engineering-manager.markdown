[Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/)  is looking for a engineering manager.  Daily doses of Linux, C++, big clusters of machines, a website with massive growth, and more. As an added bonus, you can be _working_ and read all of your unread items in Bloglines, all at the same time!



  



Interested or know someone who might be? Drop me a line: paul.querna at ask.com.
