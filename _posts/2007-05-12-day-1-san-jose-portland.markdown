Got onto the Freeway around 7:02am in San Jose.




Snapped a couple pictures of Mt. Shasta as we drove by, but none of them turned out super:

James [has some nicer shots](http://blog.duncandavidson.com/2006/12/december_snows_.html) he took a couple months ago.




One thing I noticed going north is the crazy-drivers-per-mile metric steadily decreased. Once in Oregon, we were rarely cut off, or sped past.  Although, one time a car with an oregon license plate did scream pass us, it's plate was '49ers', placing the owner as a Crazy California Driver.




Filling up with Gas in Oregon.. I completely forgot they have laws requiring Full Service Gas Stations.




Anyways, We made it into the Metro Portland area around 5:30.




[Map sites say](http://maps.ask.com/maps?ml=lt%3D43.03678%7Clg%3D-122.2998%7Cal%3D1%7Ccx%3D-5566%7Ccy%3D-2174%7Czm%3D13%7Cvt%3D0~lt%3D37.33944%7Clg%3D-121.89389%7Cad%3DSan%20Jose%2C%20CA%7Csd%3D1%7Cdm%3D0~lt%3D45.52361%7Clg%3D-122.675%7Cad%3DPortland%2C%20OR%7Csd%3D0%7Cdm%3D0~#1) it was something like 670 miles traveled today.
