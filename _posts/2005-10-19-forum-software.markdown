I am looking for suggestions & experiences for forum / bulletin board software. 



Wikipedia has a cute [comparison of many different boards.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_forum_software)



Nothing really seems to stand out.  I looked at many of their home pages, but all of the active projects have had security issues fixed in their recent releases.  Not comforting.



Of course, most of them are in PHP, and I would welcome boards in any language, but mostly I want something that is secure, that I don't have to worry about.



Currently [PunBB](http://www.punbb.org/) seems the best. Any other good ones out there?
