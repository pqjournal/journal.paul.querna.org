Okay. Dragging Images around is kinda cool. Still missing the point on how they will make money. Just using Yahoo as a default search engine can't make you really rich.  The (forced) use of technorati tags is lame.  They should insert it into my blog software. Let me make links, and don't use hard coded ones without nofollow, which just increase Technorati's PageRank.
