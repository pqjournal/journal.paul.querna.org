On Tuesday, we went up onto the Space Needle:

Beautiful day.  About as good as it can get for Seattle in May.




On Wednesday, we met up with Geoff, and went to the Mariners game:

Here is a pic of Ichiro's lead off single:

Oh, and Geoff dressed up in Angel's Gear:

And kept yelling 'Go Angels!'.




Of Course, the bad news about the Mariners game, is that they lost in a shut out to the Angels.




I started and finished reading Ghost Brigades while we were in Seattle -- only [22 more books left](http://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2007/05/12/day-2-stuff-round-portland)!.  However, I just ordered the sequel, [The Last Colony](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765316978/102-2898394-5338553), from Amazon, so now I'm back up to 23 odd unread books.




Now we are starting the drive to Spokane....
