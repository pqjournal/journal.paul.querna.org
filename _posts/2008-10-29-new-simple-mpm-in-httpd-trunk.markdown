Earlier this week, I [committed a new 'Simple' MPM](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=708462) to Apache httpd trunk.

[More info on the mailing lists](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/200810.mbox/%3C4906BB73.9040407@force-elite.com%3E).

I should write more about the Simple MPM, but [ApacheCon New Orleans](http://us.apachecon.com/c/acus2008/) isÂ  coming up next week, so I want to try to get more of the code in before then, since traditionally coding during the conference never works out, and I'll try to write up a blog post about why its cool sometime next week during the conference.
