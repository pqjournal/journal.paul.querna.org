After using [Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/) for server side javascript at [work](http://www.joost.com/), I can say I somewhat like server side javascript.Â  Others like [Steve were already convinced](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/02/next-big-language.html) a long time ago.

However, I don't really like being tied into the whole Java world because of it.

When Google released their [v8 Javascript Engine](http://code.google.com/p/v8/) earlier this year, I always wanted to build an Apache Module for it.

This afternoon I had some time, and so I [created mod_v8](https://svn.i-want-a-pony.com/repos/mod_v8/trunk/).

It doesn't do much beyond a Hello World right now, but it is as simple as this:


> 

>     
>     ap.write("Hello World!");
> 
> 



I'm not sure if I will spend time making it a proper project, I really want to spend more time on making httpd 2.4 before getting too distracted with shiny things....
