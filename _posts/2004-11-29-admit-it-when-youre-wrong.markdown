Today in Econmics class we were being lectured on Total Profit(TP), Average Costs(AC), Marginal Costs(MC), and Marginal Revenue(MR).  
  


He gave an example, and said that at **quanity 6**, you would have the highest total profit.  

  

However, using simple math (no really, just multiplication and subtraction), you can see that at **quanity 5** you have a higher total profit.



Market Price = $60;  
  


Total Profit = (Market Price - Average Costs) * Quanity  
  


At Q = 5, your Average cost is $50  

At Q = 6, your Average cost is $52  

  

Total Profit = ( $60 - $50 ) * 5 = $50  

Total Profit = ( $60 - $52 ) * 6 = $48  

  

( $50 > $48 ) = true!  




So, the professor was wrong in his example, hey it happens, we are all humans.  I raised my hand, and asked if at Q = 5, would you have a higher total profit.  I didn't use a confronting tone, and I didn't even say he was wrong. Instead of investigating my answer, he told the entire class that **I** was wrong, and to please not continue since it would mislead the class.  I decided to not make a scene, and talk to him after class.  Several other people mumbled how I was right... sigh.  
  

Talking to him after the class, he would say _'I see how you got there'_, but not that I was right.  Oh well. No reeason to make enemies of all my professors.  
  

So here is the point, one of the most important attributes I like to see in people, is the power to admit when you were wrong. Tony Blair [admits he was wrong about Iraq having WMDs](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3718150.stm), but my economics professor cannot admit he was wrong in a simple example.  Heck, last week I [started a thread](http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=110097570000003&r=1&w=2) on dev@httpd suggesting that we have an _End Of Life Policy_ for httpd-2.0.x.  It quickly became apparent that no one else agreed with me.  No reason to create a flamewar when I was wrong, and I admit that the idea in retrospec does not mesh well with Apache's paradign.  
  
 It takes a _real man_ to admit when they are wrong.
