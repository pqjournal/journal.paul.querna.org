Friday July 31 will be my last day at Joost.

It was a fun ride for the [last 19 months](http://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2008/01/18/joining-joost/).  Starting out working on Joost's P2P library, later on our Content Delivery over HTTP, and more recently writing Server Side Javascript inside Rhino, along with countless trips to Leiden and New York City.  Thanks to all of my colleagues who I worked with, Joost was a great experience.

As [announced a few weeks ago](http://paidcontent.org/article/419-joost-admits-no-future-as-portal-volpi-out-as-ceo-staff-cuts-white-labe/), Joost is changing its focus to white label services.  I took a long look at this, but in the end I decided the new Joost just wasn't for me right now in my life.

Good luck to everyone who is staying on at Joost.

My new job is [with Cloudkick](http://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2009/07/29/joining-cloudkick/).
