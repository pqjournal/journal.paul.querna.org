[Check it out](http://www.askx.com/).





[More info.](http://about.ask.com/en/docs/about/askx.shtml).




I think there will be a post about it on the [Ask.com Blog in the morning](http://blog.ask.com/).





**UPDATE:** Links to first posts about AskX:






  
  * Read/Write Web - [ Ask X - New UI for Ask.com Secretly Launched](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/ask_x.php)

  
  * Digg - [Dugg the R/W Web Post](http://digg.com/tech_news/Ask_X_New_UI_for_Ask_com_Secretly_Launched)



I think I missed the PR kit. Is it supposed to be "AskX" or "Ask X"?
