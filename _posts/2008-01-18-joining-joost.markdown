Monday will be my first day at [Joost](http://www.joost.com/).

Today is my last day at [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/) aka Ask.com ak IAC Search and Media aka IAC/Interactive.

It's been a fun [couple years here](http://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2005/06/21/new-job/), and I am very grateful for the great team I helped build at Bloglines, but it is time for me to move on.
