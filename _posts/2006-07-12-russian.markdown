I found [this cool post explaining](http://apachedev.ru/2006/07/13/mod_flvx-peredacha-potokovogo-flash-video/) my [mod_flvx](http://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2006/07/11/mod_flvx), but I haven't a clue what they are really saying.




I tried using [BableFish](http://babelfish.altavista.com/), but the first line gave me some horrible Bable:




> 
oEDBccOP ABOUT UCHPEN VMPZE Paul Querna OF CHSHCHMPTSYM OF UPVUFCHEOOSHCHK NPDKHMSH L apache of 2 DMS RPFPLPCHPK RETEDBYUY Flash OF CHYDEP.





So, I its something like 'About', My Name, Apache 2, and Flash.




Could someone who knows Russian post a mini-summary of what the article is saying?


  



**EDIT:** [wrowe](http://people.apache.org/~wrowe/) figured out that their website was sending the wrong encoding, and this is causing BableFish to fail on the whole-webpage conversion.  If I paste it in by paragraph I am able to translate it.
