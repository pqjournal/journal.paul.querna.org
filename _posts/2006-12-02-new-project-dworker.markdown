I've proposed a new [Apache Labs](http://labs.apache.org/) project: [dworker](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/labs-labs/200612.mbox/%3c4571F02F.3060606@apache.org%3e).





My goal is to make it something like [Brad](http://brad.livejournal.com/)'s [gearman](http://search.cpan.org/~bradfitz/Gearman/), but with less perl and more C.  In the long run I want to add bindings to PHP and Python, (er, and Perl if someone else writes a patch), so that you could connect  to it both with a scripting language client, but also write a task in a scripting language.
