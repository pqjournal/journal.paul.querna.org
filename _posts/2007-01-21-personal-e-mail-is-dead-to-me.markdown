This is what my inbox looks like today:

Yes, that is 31,317 unread messages in my Inbox. This is **post** sorting and filtering.





Yes, it is mostly spam.  But I am pretty sure there are some valid emails in there.





So, for personal stuff, _email is dead to me_.  I can't wade through all this spam.





For Open Source development, I still love e-mail lists, and loath some groups using 'forums' instead. Using [maildrop](http://www.courier-mta.org/maildrop/), I presort all of my lists into folders, so they are not included in the above number.





If you want to contact me, use [IRC](irc://irc.freenode.net/#httpd-dev), ICQ (18985993), Yahoo IM (pquerna), MSN(i_love_dot_net@force-elite.com), [Jabber](jabber:paul.querna@gmail.com), POTS (1-408-439-3825), comment on my blog.






If you must use e-mail, you could use one of the above methods to get a new super-secret email address.... Or you could try emailing pquerna on my apache.org account, which is the only semi-public one I do tend to read.





For those who don't understand any of this, or why I get so much spam, please look at [this animation by Mike Davidson.](http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2006/12/why-email-is-broken)





By the time I finished writing this post, my Inbox looked like this:

All 6 new emails were spam. I rest my case
